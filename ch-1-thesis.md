# Chapter 1: Thesis

## Goals

The _Reincarnate_ spell only provides options for dead Humanoids to be reincarnated as one of the 9 Humanoid species available to play in _SRD 5.2_. Instead, **we need to replace the table built into the _Reincarnate_ spell to allow the equal possibility of targeting and reincarnating into every playable species, ancestry, and creature type throughout the multiverse officially released as character options for Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition.**

Additionally, **Dungeon Masters should be empowered to apply custom weighting of results based on the species, ancestries, and creature types typically found in their given setting**, excluding some species or giving other species different odds. One example of a possible exception to equal distribution might be a world where intelligent constructs such as autognomes and warforged do not exist. The recommended solution for this situation is to re-roll if the random species does not exist in the DM's game world. They could also give other species the dice results of excluded species to increase their odds, making the table more closely resemble that of the _SRD 5.1_ version of the spell description. Though we still believe that equal odds and all options are preferable by default, DMs should always be the final decision-makers for their implementation of house rules.

## Assumptions

### Grouping

**Related ancestries are grouped together under a common species for organizational purposes.** This does not align with the options presented in some book releases, where classically grouped ancestries are split out into discrete species options (e.g. Eladrin, Sea Elves, and Shadar-kai are all considered types of Elves in _Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes_, but are separate species in _Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse_), but this setup helps keep the top-level table under control, it acknowledges that these separate branches of people have a common ancestry with shared traits, and it prevents the odds from being stacked in the favor of more diverse species such as Elves or Dragonborn.

**Species and ancestries that have been revised over time are listed as single entries.** An example of this is the chromatic and metallic Dragonborn ancestries; even though they have been printed with differing species names and traits over the years, they have the same color and metal options in _SRD 5.2_, _Fizban's Treasury of Dragons_, and _SRD 5.1_, and thus will be considered the same options for _Reincarnate_ to avoid adding more complexity than this document already manages. A single source will be listed for each entry (see **[Sourcing](#sourcing)**). When there is ambiguity over how a name correlates to previous options, a footnote will list the older names for reference.

**New associations have been established for legacy species based on mixed parentage.** Specifically, this document considers the Half-Elf and Half-Orc species to be ancestries of Elves and Orcs respectively. These two species options have been removed as player options as of _SRD 5.2_, but they will remain in this document, as all species and ancestry options remain supported by the core game rules, even if in older superseded or legacy sources.

**Boggarts, Bugbears, Goblins, Hobgoblins, and Verdan are grouped together as ancestries of a Goblinoid species**, due to their peoples' connections in lore, and in recognition of recent game updates giving many of them the shared "Goblinoid" creature tag and the Fey Ancestry trait.

**The Dhampir, Ixalan Vampire, and Zendikar Vampire are grouped together as ancestries of a Vampire species**, based on the Dhampir fulfilling a similar archetypal fantasy role and narrative origin as Vampires.

### Separating

**The lineages from _Van Richten's Guide to Ravenloft_ are not considered to be ancestries of a common species.** While they have shared mechanics for character creation or conversion, they have no actual shared origin in lore and thus are treated as separate species.

**Species adapted from other species with no connections in lore are listed as separate entries.** This includes the Flamekin from _Lorwyn: First Light_, which uses the Fire Genasi for its traits but is otherwise narratively unrelated to Genasi. A footnote will list how these adapted species are mechanically connected to their source species.

### Sourcing

**If a species or ancestry is available in multiple books, one official source will be referenced in a footnote, prioritized by cost and modernity.** The source of choice will be based on the following methodology from highest to lowest priority:

1. _**Free Beats Paid.**_ Free sources are preferred over materials that must be purchase (e.g. _SRD_ over _Player's Handbook_).
2. _**More Beats Less.**_ Sources containing the most species options are preferred over books with fewer options (e.g. _Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse_ over _Volo's Guide to Monsters_).
3. _**New Beats Old.**_ The most modern sources are preferred over older similar materials that have been superseded (e.g. _SRD 5.2_ over _SRD 5.1_).

This ensures that freely available resources are referenced whenever possible, and when free options are not available, books with the most options are preferred, so as to reduce unnecessary purchases. The Dungeon Master is the ultimate arbiter over which variant to use when multiples exist, but the general recommendation is to use whatever book the DM or a player already owns, so as to avoid buying new material just for silly table rolls.

### Setting considerations

**Equal odds have been given to every setting with limited options for species variants versus multiverse options.** This avoids an uneven distribution of setting-to-multiverse odds when rolling on some species tables, while maintaining the equal odds across all species options in the main table.

**Species with limited options within a given setting roll first for setting, then for either multiverse variant or setting-specific variant.** When a species has limited variant options in one or more settings, a roll is first made to determine the setting, with a multiverse table including all options from _SRD_ or _Player's Handbook_ plus options that do not imply or assume a setting, followed by a separate table per setting. Setting tables are limited to the variant options found in their respective settings. If the DM determines that only a setting's given options are available, roll on the setting-specific variant table. If a setting's options are identical to the multiverse options, or the DM wishes to not use setting-specific options, roll on the multiverse table.

- **If a setting book mentions that all options from a specific resource for a given species are available, then the table for each species will include options across all versions of those resources when they differ over time.** This accounts for setting books that attempt to make default species options freely available while considering that these resources are updated over time. When the resource mentioned is a _Player's Handbook_, options from each _SRD_ will also be included.
- **Dragonmarks are included on the Eberron setting table for a given species alongside unmarked variants.** Since not all the people of Eberron have dragonmarks, when a dragonmark option is present for a given species, it is listed alongside unmarked species variants when they are also available as player options. Aberrant dragonmarks are not included on these tables, since this mark is provided as a feat rather than a species option. If you roll an unmarked Eberron species, an aberrant dragonmark is available to you at DM discretion.

## How to use these tables

1. When you cast _Reincarnate_, roll on the **[Reincarnation Options](ch-2-reincarnate.md#reincarnation-options)** table to determine your species.
2. If a species has multiple options, that entry will reference a subsequent table to roll on, which will determine your specific variant. If a species has limited variant options in one or more settings, roll for setting, then roll for variant within the resulting setting, or on the multiverse table for general options.
3. Continue to follow any instructions for rolling on subsequent tables until you reach a final result, which reflects the species of your newly reincarnated body.

## Accomplishments

As of _SRD 5.2_, the _Reincarnate_ spell table no longer has weighted odds favoring some species over others, allowing for this spell to truly shine as properly weird-and-wild-nature-magic-y and not assume a given distribution as being typical to every world in the multiverse. We celebrate this change and take full credit for it, assuming this to be a direct response to this project and thesis.

## Frequently asked questions

### Who even uses this terrible spell?

Someone probably does! This document can also just act as a dice-driven randomizer to use during character creation. If we're not sharing giant lists of homebrew tables every once in awhile, we're not doing D&D right.

### How do I roll a d5, d11, or any of these other weird tables?

**Method 1:** Select the die with the next-highest value, and re-roll for any results not on the table. For example, a d6 can be rolled for a d5 table, with a 6 requiring a re-roll.

**Method 2:** As with rolling percentile dice, roll for each digit. For example, if the **Reincarnation Options** table has 54 results, first roll for the tens position (in this example, the tens position has six options, so roll a d6 and consider a 6 to be a 0), then for the ones position with a d10, rerolling an individual die if it creates an invalid result, such as a 56 or 00 (which would be 60).
