# Chapter 1: Thesis

## Goals

- **We need to replace the d100 table built into the _reincarnate_ spell to allow the possibility of reincarnating into every playable species and ancestry officially released for Dungeon & Dragons 5th Edition.**
- The current d100 table has weighted odds based on specific species, but for this spell to truly shine as properly weird-and-wild-nature-magic-y and not assume a given distribution as being typical to every world in the multiverse, **all species and all ancestries should have roughly equal odds by default.**
- **Dungeon Masters should be empowered to apply custom weighting of results based on the species and ancestries typically found in their given setting**, excluding some species or giving other species different odds. One example of a possible exception to equal distribution might be a world where intelligent constructs such as autognomes and warforged do not exist. The recommended solution for this situation is to re-roll if the d100 lands on a species that does not exist in the DM's game world. They could also give other species the dice results of excluded species to increase their odds, making the table more closely resemble that of the original spell text.

## Assumptions

- **Related ancestries are grouped together under a common species for organizational purposes.** This does not align with the options presented in some book releases, where classically grouped ancestries are split out into discrete species options (e.g. eladrin, sea elves, and shadar-kai are all considered types of elves in _Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes_, but are separate species in _Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse_), but this setup helps keep the top-level table under control, it acknowledges that these separate branches of people have a common ancestry with shared traits, and it prevents the odds from being stacked in the favor of more diverse species such as elves or dragonborn.
- **Species and ancestries that have been revised over time are listed as single entries.** An example of this is the chromatic and metallic dragonborn; even though they have been printed with differing species names and traits over the years, they have the same color and metal options in _Systems Reference Document 5.1_, _Fizban's Treasury of Dragons_, and the _Player's Handbook (2024)_, and thus will be considered the same options for _reincarnate_ to avoid adding more complexity than this document already manages. The Dungeon Master will be the ultimate arbiter over which variant to use when multiples exist, but the general recommendation would be to use whatever book the DM or a player already owns to avoid buying new material just based on silly table rolls.

- **If a species or ancestry is available in multiple books, one official source will be referenced in a footnote**. The source of choice will be based on the following methodology from highest to lowest priority:

  1. Free sources (e.g. _SRD 5.1_ over _Player's Handbook (2014)_)
  2. Sources containing the most species options (e.g. _Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse_ over _Volo's Guide to Monsters_)
  3. The most modern sources (e.g. _Player's Handbook (2024)_ over _Player's Handbook (2014)_)

- **New associations have been formed for legacy species based on mixed parentage.** Specifically, this document considers the half-elf and half-orc species to be ancestries of elves and orcs respectively. These two species options are being phased out of the game as of _Player's Handbook (2024)_ in favor of removing mixed parentage from consideration for mechanical traits, but they will remain in this document, as all 5e species and ancestries remain supported by the core game rules, even if in older superseded or legacy sources.
- **Bugbears, goblins, and hobgoblins are grouped together as ancestries of the goblinoid species**, due to their peoples' connections in lore, and in recognition of recent game updates giving them the shared "goblinoid" creature tag and the Fey Ancestry trait.
- **The lineages from _Van Richten's Guide to Ravenloft_ are not considered to be ancestries of a common species.** While they have shared mechanics for character creation or conversion, they have no actual shared origin in lore and thus are treated as separate species.
- **Species with multiple possible dragonmark ancestries roll for dragonmark on a separate table.** This avoids an uneven distribution of Eberron-to-multiverse odds when rolling on some species tables, particularly the Human table. All species with the possibility of having multiple ancestral dragonmarks will have a single "Dragonmarked" option on their species tables, prompting a separate roll for dragonmark (aberrant dragonmarks are not included since this is provided as a feat rather than a species option).

## Who even uses this terrible spell?

Someone probably does! This document can also just act as a dice-driven randomizer to use during character creation. If we're not sharing giant lists of homebrew tables every once in awhile, we're not doing D&D right.
