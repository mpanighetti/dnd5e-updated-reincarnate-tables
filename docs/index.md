# Updated Reincarnate Tables

_Reincarnate_. We love it! It's a perfect spell, best way to bring back allies from death, no notes. Well maybe just the one: we need more reincarnation options! Since the spell was written back at the beginning of Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition, we've gotten access to many more options for playable species and ancestries beyond what's offered in the _SRD_, published books, and D&D Beyond, but the spell hasn't kept up with the times. So let's update it! With bigger and more tables!
