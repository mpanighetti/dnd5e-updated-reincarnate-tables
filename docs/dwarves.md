[^🪓]: The Dwarf was updated in _SRD 5.2_ to remove ancestry selection. The Gold Dwarf and Shield Dwarf of the Forgotten Realms are mechanically equivalent to a Dwarf in _SRD 5.2_ and a Hill Dwarf in _SRD 5.1_, and the Duergar in _Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse_ is mechanically equivalent to a Gray Dwarf in _Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide_.
