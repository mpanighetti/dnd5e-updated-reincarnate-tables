# Updated Reincarnate Tables

## Introduction

_Reincarnate_. We love it! It's a perfect spell, best way to bring back allies from death, no notes. Well maybe just the one: we need more reincarnation options! Since the spell was written back at the beginning of Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition, we've gotten access to many more options for playable species and ancestries beyond what's offered in the _System Reference Document_, published books, and D&D Beyond, but the spell hasn't kept up with the times. So let's update it! With bigger and more tables!

## Goals

- **We need to replace the d100 table built into the _reincarnate_ spell to allow the possibility of reincarnating into every playable species and ancestry officially released for Dungeon & Dragons 5th Edition.**
- The current d100 table has weighted odds based on specific species, but for this spell to truly shine as properly weird-and-wild-nature-magic-y and not assume a given distribution as being typical to every world in the multiverse, **all species should have roughly equal odds by default.**
- **Dungeon Masters should be empowered to apply custom weighting of results based on the species typically found in their given setting**, excluding some species or giving other species different odds. One example of a possible exception to equal distribution might be a world where intelligent constructs such as autognomes and warforged do not exist. The recommended solution for this situation is to re-roll if the d100 lands on a species that does not exist in the DM's game world. They could also give other species the dice results of excluded species to increase their odds, making the table more closely resemble that of the original spell text.

## Assumptions

- **Related ancestries are grouped together under a common species for organizational purposes.** This does not align with current D&D book structures, where classically grouped ancestries (e.g. eladrin, sea elves, and shadar-kai all being considered types of elves) are now split out into discrete species options, but this setup helps keep the top-level table under control, it acknowledges that these separate branches of people have a common ancestry with shared traits, and it prevents the odds from being stacked in the favor of more diverse species such as elves or dragonborn.
- **Species and ancestries that have been revised over time are combined into single entries.** An example of this is the chromatic dragonborn; even though they have been printed with differing features over the years, they have the same color options in the _2014 Player's Handbook_, _Fizban's Treasury of Dragons_, and the _2024 Player's Handbook_, and thus will be considered the same options for _reincarnate_ to avoid adding more complexity than this document already manages. The Dungeon Master will be the ultimate arbiter over which variant to use when multiples exist, but the general recommendation would be to use whatever book the DM or a player already owns to avoid buying new material just based on silly table rolls for extreme game edge cases.
- **New associations have been formed for legacy species based on mixed parentage.** Specifically, the "half-elf" and "half-orc" species are now considered ancestries of elves and orcs respectively. These two species options are being phased out of the game as of _2024 Player's Handbook_ in favor of removing mixed parentage from consideration for mechanical traits, but they will remain in this document, as all 5e species and ancestries remain supported by the core game rules, even if in older superseded books.
- **Bugbears, goblins, and hobgoblins are grouped together as ancestries of the goblinoid species**, due to their peoples' connections in lore and recent game updates giving them the shared "goblinoid" creature tag and the Fey Ancestry trait.
- **The lineages from Van Richten's Guide to Ravenloft are not considered to be ancestries of a common species.** While they have shared mechanics for character creation or conversion, they have no actual shared origin in lore and thus are treated as separate species.

## Who Even Uses This Terrible Spell?

Someone probably does! This document can also just act as a dice-driven randomizer to use during character creation. If we're not sharing giant lists of homebrew tables every once in awhile, we're not doing D&D right.
