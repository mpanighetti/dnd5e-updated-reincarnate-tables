# Updated Reincarnate Tables

_Reincarnate_. We love it! It's a perfect spell, best way to bring back allies from death, no notes. Well maybe just the one: we need more reincarnation options! Since the spell was written back at the beginning of Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition, we've gotten access to many more options for playable species and ancestries beyond what's offered in the _System Reference Document_, published books, and D&D Beyond, but the spell hasn't kept up with the times. So let's update it! With bigger and more tables!

## Compatibility

This content was written to be compatible with Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition. It makes the following modifications from _Systems Reference Document 5.1_:

- "Species" is used in place of "race". "Ancestry" or "variant" is used in place of "subrace".
- This document uses new traits called **Condition Resistance** and **Condition Vulnerability**. Resistance to a condition means that a creature has Advantage on Saving Throws made to resist that condition, and vulnerability to a condition means that a creature has Disadvantage on such Saving Throws.
- Damage and condition resistance, vulnerability, and immunity are now grouped together as **Resistances**, **Vulnerabilities**, and **Immunities** respectively.
- Resistance, vulnerability, and immunity to Poison apply to both the damage type and the Poisoned condition.
